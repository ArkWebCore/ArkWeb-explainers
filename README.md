# ArkWeb Explainers

This repository is for explainers outlining potential new requirements, features, or improvements for the web platform from the ArkWeb community, with the goal of contributing to the W3C standardization process.

These explainers are created by members of the ArkWeb technology community and are intended as an open invitation for community feedback and discussion.

Each explainer typically begins by identifying a gap or limitation in todayâ€™s web experience, followed by preliminary ideas or design directions that could address the issue. The content is expected to evolve significantly as ideas mature, feedback is incorporated, and use cases are better understood.

Explainers that gain broader support and clearer technical direction may later be transitioned into formal incubation venues, such as W3C Community or Working Groups, for further refinement and potential standardization. Inactive or deprecated proposals will be archived but remain accessible for reference.

This collaborative space aims to improve the web platform through testing and piloting new features on ArkWeb. The repository contains proposals organized in directories. 

## Contributions

For a homogeneous organization of the repository, proposals are included in dedicated directories (one directory per proposal). Each directory contains a single `explainer.md` file. It may also include other resources, such as images, configuration files, and examples.    

The directory names must be concise and have a meaningful title, following the [CamelCase notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). 

The presence of an explainer does not imply consensus among all contributors or endorsement by any specific standards body. Instead, it reflects the beginning of a shared exploration of how the web can evolve to serve users and developers better.

We welcome thoughtful contributions, questions, and feedback from across the web community.
